## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Albums
* Delete all Albums
* Find Albums by their ID (`select`)
* List All Albums (`select_all`)

Each album should have a name/title, genre and artist_name

## Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* Edit Albums
* Delete One Album

Remember to regularly git commit!
